## Knowledge Management

Road Notes is a knowledge management system built by transit operators for transit operators. It captures the practical wisdom that makes the difference between running a route and running it well—the timing strategies, safety considerations, and operational realities that only come from experience behind the wheel.

This is not official documentation. It's the informal knowledge that operators share with each other: which intersections are consistently tight, where passenger flow surges, which stops have tricky clearances, and what actually works when the schedule and reality don't align.

## The Mission Statement

Transit operations demand professional knowledge. Road Notes provides infrastructure for operators to document, share, and access that knowledge systematically.

**By operators, for operators. Driving excellence.**
