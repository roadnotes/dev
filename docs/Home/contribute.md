# Contributing to Road Notes

Road Notes grows through operator contributions. This platform belongs to the professional community of transit operators. Your knowledge and experience strengthen the resource for everyone.

## What Makes a Good Road Note Submission

Strong route contributions share these characteristics:

**Specificity:** Good Road Notes provide concrete, actionable information. Instead of "this intersection is dangerous," write "Cedar Hill X Road/Shelbourne intersection—heavy right-turn conflicts with cyclists in bike lane, especially PM peak." Specific information helps operators prepare for actual conditions.

**Experience-Based Knowledge:** The best contributions come from having run a route extensively. Document what you've learned through actual operation—the timing realities, the recurring problems, the effective techniques you've developed.

**Professional Tone:** Road Notes maintain professional standards. Contributions should be respectful, factual, and focused on operational excellence. Avoid complaints, personal grievances, or criticism of management, passengers, or other operators.

**Safety Focus:** Prioritize information that prevents incidents and protects operators and passengers. Safety knowledge is the most valuable content you can contribute.

**Practical Utility:** Ask yourself: "Would this information help another operator run this route better?" If yes, it belongs in Road Notes. If it's interesting but not operationally useful, reconsider the contribution.

## What Makes a Good Pro Note Submission

Strong professional articles demonstrate these qualities:

**Deep Expertise:** Pro Notes should come from operators with substantial experience in the topic area. You don't need to be perfect—you need to have learned through real practice and be willing to share that knowledge.

**Evidence-Based Approach:** Ground your recommendations in operational reality, safety principles, and professional standards. Reference applicable regulations, policies, or best practices where relevant.

**Comprehensive Coverage:** Pro Notes should thoroughly address their topic. Good articles provide context, explain principles, offer practical techniques, discuss common errors, and help readers understand not just what to do but why.

**Professional Development Focus:** The goal is to make operators better at their work. Every Pro Note should help readers improve their skills, knowledge, or professional practice.

**Clear, Direct Writing:** Professional writing respects readers' time and intelligence. Be clear, be specific, avoid jargon when simpler language works, and organize content logically.

All submissions are reviewed by a panel of experienced operators before publication. This peer review process ensures accuracy, maintains professional standards, and protects the credibility of the platform.

## Editorial Review Process

Every contribution goes through systematic review:

**Initial Assessment:** Editorial team verifies the contributor's operational background and assesses whether the submission meets basic quality standards.

**Peer Review:** Experienced operators review the content for accuracy, safety, professional tone, and practical value. Reviewers may be operators from the same system or from other transit agencies with relevant experience.

**Revision and Refinement:** Most submissions require some revision. The editorial team works with contributors to strengthen content, clarify information, and ensure professional presentation.

**Final Approval:** Once content meets all standards, it's published on the site and attributed to the contributing operator (by role/experience level, not by name, unless the contributor requests attribution).

This process takes time—typically 2-4 weeks from submission to publication. Quality matters more than speed. Road Notes maintains rigorous standards because your professional reputation and the platform's credibility depend on the accuracy and utility of published content.
