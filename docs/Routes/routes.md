# What Are Road Notes?

Road Notes are route-specific operational knowledge written by the operators who run these routes daily. They document the ground truth of transit operations—the timing realities that schedules don't capture, the safety considerations that only become apparent behind the wheel, and the passenger patterns that shape your workday.

## What You'll Find in Each Route

Every route page is organized around the information that matters most to professional operation:

**Timing Notes** document the real-world challenges of maintaining schedule. Where does the published schedule assume conditions that rarely exist? Which timing points are consistently tight? Where do delays accumulate? Which sections offer recovery opportunities? This knowledge helps you manage your run professionally and understand when you're fighting impossible timing versus when you need to improve your pace.

**Safety Considerations** identify hazards specific to each route. These aren't generic safety reminders—they're specific warnings about dangerous intersections, blind corners, aggressive traffic patterns, pedestrian conflict zones, and environmental conditions that create risk. This is the knowledge experienced operators wish they'd had on their first day running a route.

**Stop-Specific Information** covers the unusual configurations, access challenges, and operational quirks of individual stops. Which stops have tight clearances? Where do wheelchair ramps deploy onto problematic surfaces? Which poles are set back requiring wide approaches? This detail prevents the incidents that come from operating unfamiliar stops without local knowledge.

**Passenger Flow Patterns** describe who uses the route, when they board, and what they need. Understanding whether you're running a commuter express, a tourist route, a school service, or neighborhood transit changes how you manage service. This knowledge helps you anticipate demand, prepare for surges, and deliver appropriate service for your ridership.

**Operational Tips** provide the professional knowledge that makes the job easier and safer. These are the insights that separate competent operators from excellent ones—the equipment quirks, the communication strategies, the timing techniques, and the professional approaches that experienced operators develop over years of service.

## How to Use Road Notes

Road Notes are reference material, not required reading. Use them strategically:

**Before running a new route:** Read the full page to understand what you're getting into. Pay particular attention to safety considerations and timing notes. Print or bookmark routes you run regularly.

**When preparing for challenging conditions:** Review safety considerations and operational tips relevant to weather, traffic, or service conditions you're facing.

**After experiencing problems:** Check if the issue you encountered is documented. If it is, learn from others' experience. If it isn't, consider contributing that knowledge.

**During route familiarization:** Use Road Notes alongside official route training to build complete operational understanding.

Road Notes complement formal procedures and training—they don't replace them. Official policies, safety protocols, and operational procedures always take precedence. Road Notes provide the context and practical knowledge that help you apply those standards effectively.
