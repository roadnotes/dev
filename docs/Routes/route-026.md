# Route 26 - Gorge/Tillicum

## Timing Notes

- Gorge Road eastbound AM: consistently 3-5 minutes behind schedule due to school traffic
- Tillicum Centre layover is 8 minutes - adequate for on-time arrival, tight if delayed
- Admirals Road routing has complex intersection delays, particularly at Craigflower
- Trans-Canada Highway crossing at Admirals: long light cycle, can lose 2-3 minutes waiting
- Evening runs generally well-timed, AM peak consistently tight

## Safety Considerations

- **Tillicum Road between Burnside and Carey** - Heavy industrial truck traffic, maintain defensive positioning
- Gorge Road has multiple schools: Shoreline, Sundance, Gorge Vale - school zones strictly enforced
- **Admirals/Craigflower intersection** - Six-phase light, aggressive left-turners, high-conflict zone
- Tillicum Mall area: pedestrians crossing mid-block near stores, heightened scanning required
- **Gorge Road West** - Narrow with bike lane, cyclists frequent this corridor, share road professionally

## Stop-Specific Information

- **Tillicum Centre terminal** - Bay shared with Route 11, coordinate spacing with other operators
- **Stop 2645 (Gorge at Harriet)** - Stop pole obscured by trees in summer, easy to miss
- **Admirals Walk area stops** - New development, high senior population, mobility device usage
- **Stop 2689 (Tillicum at Obed)** - Industrial area, shift workers with toolboxes and equipment
- **Craigflower Village** - Wheelchair ramp deploys onto uneven pavement, spot carefully

## Passenger Flow Patterns

- Industrial workers dominate AM outbound, PM inbound - shift changes at Esquimalt industrial areas
- School traffic creates chaos 0800-0830 and 1500-1530 weekdays
- Tillicum Mall traffic peaks midday and early evening for shopping
- Seniors frequent route for medical appointments and shopping at Tillicum Centre
- Weekend recreational traffic to Gorge waterway parks and rowing club

## Operational Tips

- **Pre-trip your stop announcements** - Multiple similar street names (Admirals/Admirals Walk, Tillicum/Tillicum Centre)
- This route serves working-class neighborhoods - passengers expect reliable, no-nonsense service
- Gorge Road bike lane creates tight clearances - don't crowd cyclists passing stopped cars
- Know your industrial shift times - you'll see the same workers daily, professional rapport matters
- Tillicum Centre has washroom access in mall, food court for meal breaks
- Winter: Gorge Road hills are manageable but respect grades, particularly westbound from Harriet

## Route Character

The 26 is a working route serving working people. Industrial employees, school kids, seniors, and service workers make up your ridership. They need reliable service to get to work, school, and essential errands.

This isn't a tourist route or a university express. It's neighborhood service connecting residential areas to employment centers and commercial hubs. Your passengers know the system, know their stops, and expect professional, punctual service.

Master your timing discipline. The route has natural choke points where delays accumulate, but also sections where you can make up time if you're behind. Learn to read your run and adjust your pace.

School traffic will test your patience. Industrial workers rushing to punch in will pressure you to skip stops or speed up. Maintain professional standards regardless of pressure.
