# Route 6 - Downtown/Esquimalt

## Timing Notes

- Westbound AM peak: Esquimalt Road gets congested at Admirals/Esquimalt intersection, add 3-5 minutes to schedule assumptions
- Eastbound PM: Government Street downtown crawls 1630-1800, nearly impossible to maintain schedule
- Dockyard shift changes (0730, 1530): massive passenger surges at Naden gates, allow extra dwell time
- Esquimalt Rec Centre layover is 7 minutes - barely adequate after a late run, no time for washroom
- Bay Street Bridge raises occasionally for naval vessels - can lose 10+ minutes, radio dispatch immediately

## Safety Considerations

- **Esquimalt Road between Head St and Lampson** - Narrow lanes, parked cars both sides, pedestrians cross mid-block regularly
- **Government Street downtown** - Constant pedestrian jaywalking, tourist season is chaos, crawl speed and high vigilance
- **Admirals Road/Esquimalt intersection** - Complex multi-phase lights, aggressive left-turners from all directions
- Dockyard gates: military police present, professional conduct essential, no photos/phones near base
- **Westbound at Lyall/Head** - Blind corner with pedestrians stepping out from buildings, sound horn before intersection
- Evening runs: Douglas Street bar district requires heightened awareness for impaired pedestrians

## Stop-Specific Information

- **CFB Esquimalt gates (stops 6145, 6147)** - Security restrictions, some passengers require base access, can't loiter
- **Stop 6089 (Esquimalt Rd at Fraser)** - Wheelchair ramp deploys onto narrow sidewalk with utility pole, spot carefully
- **Stop 6234 (Government at Fort)** - Heaviest passenger load point downtown, shelter creates boarding chaos, manage the line
- **Bay Street terminal** - Shared with Routes 14 and 15, coordinate spacing with other operators
- **Stop 6156 (Head St at Esquimalt)** - Stop request button frequently broken, watch for passengers preparing to exit

## Passenger Flow Patterns

- Military personnel dominate AM outbound (0630-0800) and PM inbound (1500-1700) - Dockyard shifts
- Downtown government workers create reverse commute patterns
- Seniors frequent the route midday for medical appointments at Esquimalt Plaza area
- Weekend traffic: mixed recreational to downtown, pub crowds Friday/Saturday evenings
- First Nations passengers traveling between Songhees and Esquimalt communities - route serves important cultural connections

## Operational Tips

- **Pre-announce at downtown**: "Route 6 to Esquimalt" - tourists confuse it with Route 14
- Learn your military regulars - professional courtesy builds rapport, they're shift workers like us
- Esquimalt Road is a bike route - expect cyclists in lane, be patient and professional
- Government Street: you WILL be late during peak, don't compound it by rushing unsafely
- Know your de-escalation skills - evening runs attract intoxicated passengers, stay calm and professional
- Radio is your friend - Bay Street Bridge lifts, Dockyard gate delays, downtown gridlock: communicate early
- The 6 runs through multiple communities with distinct characters - adapt your approach accordingly

## Professional Notes

Route 6 is a challenging urban route requiring constant situational awareness. You're operating in tight quarters through heavy pedestrian areas, serving a major military installation with security requirements, and managing diverse passenger populations with competing needs.

The route rewards operators who can maintain schedule discipline while accepting that downtown and Esquimalt Road will sometimes make that impossible. Know when to push your pace safely and when to accept you're going to be late and just focus on getting everyone there safely.

Master your timing points. The route has natural choke points where you'll lose time (Admirals intersection, Government Street, Dockyard gates) and sections where you can make up time if you're running late (Esquimalt Road westbound off-peak, Bay Street). Learn to read your runs and adjust.

Military passengers expect punctuality and professionalism - deliver both when possible. Downtown tourists need patience and clear communication. Evening passengers may need firm boundaries. One route, multiple professional skill sets required.

## Local Knowledge

- Esquimalt has deep naval history - CFB Esquimalt is Canada's Pacific naval base, continuous operation since 1865
- The route serves Songhees Nation community connections - respect and professionalism always
- Esquimalt Road was the original Victoria-Esquimalt corridor before the highway - narrow because it predates buses
- "The Dockyard" refers to CFB Esquimalt - operators don't need to know military details, just traffic patterns
- Bay Street Bridge is a bascule bridge (drawbridge) - opens for naval vessels entering/exiting the harbor, infrequent but unpredictable
