# Route 12 - Mayfair/Lansdowne

## Timing Notes

- Morning outbound to Mayfair: allow extra time at Quadra/Tolmie, left turn signal is short cycle
- Inbound downtown runs are generally well-padded except Friday evenings (retail traffic)
- Lansdowne loop has 5-minute recovery - adequate for most runs, tight if you're behind
- Bay Centre stop adds 2+ minutes during cruise ship days (May-September)

## Safety Considerations

- **Fort/Cook intersection** - Pedestrians cross against signal regularly, especially near Starbucks
- Lansdowne Middle School (stops 1245-1247): heavy student traffic 0800-0830 and 1500-1530, behavioral management required
- **Mayfair Mall loop** - Delivery trucks block sightlines, crawl speed through parking area
- Government Street downtown: tourists step into traffic for photos, stay alert
- Pandora/Cook area: compassionate awareness of vulnerable populations, maintain professional boundaries

## Stop-Specific Information

- **Stop 1289 (Outbound Fort at Moss)** - Narrow stop, cars park too close. Sometimes need to block lane to serve stop safely
- **Stop 1234 (Inbound at Bay Centre)** - High passenger volume, shelter creates queuing issues, manage boarding efficiently
- **Mayfair terminal** - Enter from Douglas, exit onto Finlayson. Do NOT attempt to enter from Finlayson, you'll get stuck
- **Stop 1256 (Lansdowne at Cecelia)** - School zone, 30 km/h strictly enforced, photo radar frequent

## Passenger Flow Patterns

- Retail workers dominate AM outbound, PM inbound (Mayfair and downtown malls)
- Midday: seniors shopping, medical appointments at clusters along Fort Street
- School traffic creates chaos 1500-1545 weekdays at Lansdowne
- Friday/Saturday evenings: mixed downtown nightlife traffic, stay professional
- Sundays are quiet except for church traffic AM at various stops

## Operational Tips

- Route serves dense residential areas - you'll get flagged down between stops, maintain stop discipline professionally
- Mayfair Mall washroom access during mall hours, use it during layover
- This route gets a mix of seasoned regulars and new riders - balance efficiency with patience
- Bay Centre stop: if passenger load is heavy, consider announcing "Move back please" before you even open doors
- Know your youth fare policies - Lansdowne school runs will test this daily
- Winter: Fort Street hills are manageable but respect the grade, especially outbound from Cook

## Route Character

The 12 is a workhorse neighborhood route connecting residential areas to two major shopping centers and downtown. You'll see the same faces regularly - learn your regulars, it builds professional rapport and makes service smoother. The route requires situational awareness: school zones, pedestrian-heavy retail areas, and vulnerable populations all on one line.

Expect variety. Morning runs are predictable commuter traffic, midday is seniors and service users, afternoons bring school chaos, and evenings can be unpredictable. Master your timing points and maintain consistent, professional service. This route rewards operators who can read traffic patterns and adjust their driving accordingly.
