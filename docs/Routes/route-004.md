# Route 4 - Shelbourne Corridor

## Timing Notes

- Southbound morning runs are consistently tight between McKenzie and Hillside - schedule assumes green lights that rarely happen
- Northbound PM peak: factor extra 3-4 minutes at Hillside Exchange for passenger loading
- The 15-minute layover at Royal Oak is adequate except during shift changes at the hospital (0645-0715, 1445-1515)

## Safety Considerations

- **Cedar Hill X Road/Shelbourne intersection** - Heavy right-turn conflicts with cyclists in bike lane, especially PM peak
- Northbound stop before McKenzie: steep grade, ensure parking brake set during passenger boarding in winter
- Watch for medical transport vehicles making sudden stops near Jubilee Hospital
- Shelbourne/Hillside has aggressive light timing - don't rush yellows, you won't make it

## Stop-Specific Information

- **Stop 4512 (Northbound at Pear St)** - Pole is set back from curb, tight clearance with parked cars. Take wide approach
- **Stop 4589 (Southbound at Cedar Hill Rec)** - Wheelchair ramp deploys onto a slight camber, spot your exit carefully
- **Jubilee Hospital stops** - High volume of mobility aids and walkers, allow extra dwell time
- **Gordon Head Rec Centre** - After-school chaos 1500-1630, expect multiple bikes and strollers

## Passenger Flow Patterns

- Morning: Heavy UVic student traffic northbound, expect full bus by McKenzie
- Afternoon: Medical appointments dominate midday traffic to/from Jubilee
- Evening: Grocery shoppers at Shelbourne Plaza (Southbound around 1700-1830)
- Weekends: Recreation Centre traffic creates unexpected peaks

## Operational Tips

- Pre-trip the stop request chimes - this route has the oldest fleet assignment and buttons stick
- Royal Oak layover has no facilities - plan accordingly
- Keep announcements clear at university stops - lots of new riders unfamiliar with the system
- The route serves three schools - expect behavioral issues and know your de-escalation protocols
