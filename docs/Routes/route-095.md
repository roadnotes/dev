# Route 95 - Woodwyn/Interurban Express

## Timing Notes

- **Critical**: This is an express limited-stop route. Timing assumes you maintain highway speeds and don't service local stops
- Morning inbound: West Saanich Road traffic backs up at Quadra merge, can lose 5+ minutes here
- Only stop at designated express stops unless passenger emergency
- Interurban terminal recovery time is tight - 6 minutes includes turnaround and farebox reconciliation

## Safety Considerations

- **Highway speeds require increased following distance** - particularly in wet conditions on West Saanich
- Royal Oak/West Saanich merge: trucks entering from industrial area, maintain lane position
- **Interurban terminal has tight turning radius** - check clearance on both sides
- This route attracts riders unfamiliar with transit - expect questions, pre-announce stops clearly
- Aggressive passenger behavior rare but address immediately - long gaps between stops limits your options

## Stop-Specific Information

- **McKenzie Exchange** - Bay 6, arrive on time or early for timed transfers, 95 is a connector route
- **Broadmead Village** - Stop is on thoroughfare, not in parking lot. Passengers often walk from wrong location
- **Interurban terminal** - Shared with Route 87, coordinate with other operators during peak
- Limited stops mean passengers expect punctuality - this isn't a milk run

## Passenger Flow Patterns

- Commuter-heavy, peak direction traffic (inbound AM, outbound PM)
- Midday: seniors and medical appointments to Royal Jubilee area via transfer
- Minimal recreational traffic - this is a workhorse route
- Regulars know the drill, but tourist season brings confusion about express service

## Operational Tips

- **Pre-announce at downtown departure**: "Route 95 Express - limited stops only, next stop McKenzie Exchange"
- Maintain express discipline - local stop requests should be denied professionally with explanation
- Your schedule assumes green lights and clear traffic - drive assertively but safely to maintain timing
- Farebox issues: less cash handling than local routes, but card reader problems strand passengers with limited options
- Know your transfer connections at McKenzie - you're part of a network
- Radio check before departure - long stretches without supervision, need reliable comms

## Professional Notes

The 95 requires confidence and assertiveness. You're moving people efficiently over distance. Master your timing points, know your traffic patterns, maintain your schedule. This route separates operators who can maintain discipline from those who let service creep into local patterns.

Respect the route's purpose: fast, reliable, express service. Your passengers chose this route specifically for that reason.
