# Route 14 - UVic/University Heights

## Timing Notes

- University term timing is critical: September-April runs are 5-8 minutes slower than summer schedule
- Class change times (hourly on the hour ±10 minutes): massive boarding surges, dwell time doubles
- Ring Road campus loop: officially 4 minutes, realistically 6-8 minutes during academic year
- Downtown to campus runs tight during PM peak, campus to downtown well-padded
- Exam periods (December, April): unpredictable timing, students stressed and impatient

## Safety Considerations

- **Ring Road on campus** - Pedestrians step into traffic constantly, assume they won't look
- Shelbourne/McKenzie intersection: heavy right-turn conflicts, watch for cyclists
- **Gordon Head residential area** - Narrow streets, parked cars, children playing during after-school hours
- Campus loop has multiple tight turns with limited visibility - crawl speed essential
- Cedar Hill X Road/Shelbourne: aggressive drivers attempting to beat bus, maintain lane position

## Stop-Specific Information

- **UVic Exchange** - Multiple bays, Routes 4, 14, 26, 28 all converge here, coordinate with dispatch
- **Clearihue Building stop** - Heaviest campus load point, shelter inadequate for demand, manage overflow professionally
- **Stop 1434 (McKenzie at Glanford)** - Major transfer point, announce connections clearly
- **Campus stops during summer** - Reduced service, different stop patterns, verify summer schedule
- **Finnerty Road stops** - Serve student housing, evening boarding can be chaotic with groceries/bikes

## Passenger Flow Patterns

- Academic year: overwhelmingly student traffic, age 18-25, limited transit experience
- Class change surges: 0850-0910, 1150-1210, 1450-1510, 1750-1810
- Co-op terms (Jan-April, May-Aug): workplace commuters mix with students
- Summer (May-Aug): dramatically reduced demand, primarily summer session and staff
- Exam periods: late-night service heavy, anxiety levels high, compassion required

## Operational Tips

- **Farebox management during surges**: Keep line moving, don't hold bus for fare disputes
- Student U-Pass issues are common - know your policies, enforce consistently
- Backpacks and oversized items are daily challenges - be firm about aisle clearance
- This route requires crowd management skills - full buses are routine during term
- Campus events (frosh week, exams, graduation): expect chaos, plan accordingly
- **Communication is essential**: Pre-announce stops clearly, many riders are new to route
- Patience during September: thousands of new students learning the system simultaneously

## Route Character

The 14 during academic year is high-volume, high-stress urban service. You're moving hundreds of students per shift, managing full buses, and dealing with inexperienced transit users who treat the bus like a social space.

September is initiation by fire: new students, full loads, constant fare questions, backpack chaos. By October, your regulars know the routine. Exam periods bring different stress: quiet, anxious passengers who just want reliable service.

Summer is a completely different route: light loads, relaxed pace, experienced riders. Use summer to master your timing points and prepare for September's chaos.

This route demands assertive passenger management. You'll enforce capacity limits, manage boarding efficiently, and maintain order on crowded buses. Your regular commuters will appreciate firm professional standards that keep service moving.

## Academic Calendar Considerations

- **Fall term**: September-December (chaos in September, settles by October)
- **Spring term**: January-April (reading break in February creates temporary relief)
- **Summer sessions**: May-August (dramatically reduced service demand)
- **Exam periods**: December and April (late-night service heavy, extended hours)
- **Frosh week** (early September): absolute peak demand, new students everywhere
- **Graduation**: June (campus access restricted, routing may change, check bulletins)

## Professional Development

The 14 teaches you crowd management, fare enforcement under pressure, and high-volume service delivery. Master this route and you can handle any urban service challenge the system offers.

Your patience will be tested. Your professional standards will be challenged. Your ability to maintain service discipline while treating passengers with respect will be essential.

This is not an easy route. It's a professional proving ground. Approach it with proper mindset: you're providing essential service to a community that depends on reliable transit. Do it well.
