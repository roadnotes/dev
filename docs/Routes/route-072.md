# Route 72 - Swartz Bay/Sidney

## Timing Notes

- **Ferry-dependent timing**: BC Ferries arrival at Swartz Bay creates 100+ passenger surges, dwell time unpredictable
- Highway 17 traffic varies dramatically: free-flowing or gridlocked with no middle ground
- McTavish/Highway 17 interchange delays can cost 5+ minutes during any incident
- Sidney downtown routing is tight - parking and delivery trucks create constant obstacles
- Recovery at Swartz Bay: 12 minutes including turnaround, barely adequate after ferry arrival

## Safety Considerations

- **Highway 17 speeds up to 90 km/h** - Requires maximum following distance and advanced scanning
- Shoulder is limited in sections - breakdown creates immediate hazard
- **Sidney downtown (Beacon Avenue)** - Narrow street, angle parking, constant pedestrian traffic
- Swartz Bay terminal access road: steep grade, tour buses and RVs create width restrictions
- Patricia Bay Highway construction is perpetual - check bulletins daily for lane restrictions

## Stop-Specific Information

- **Swartz Bay Ferry Terminal** - Chaos during arrivals, hundreds of passengers with luggage, manage boarding systematically
- **Stop 7245 (Beacon Avenue at 5th)** - Downtown Sidney's busiest stop, shelter inadequate for demand
- **McTavish Exchange** - Transfer point for Routes 70, 71, 83, coordinate connections
- **Stop 7289 (McDonald Park)** - Recreation facility, weekend youth sports create unexpected peaks
- **Bazan Bay stops** - Marine research facilities, parking limited, passengers sometimes running to catch bus

## Passenger Flow Patterns

- Ferry arrivals dominate: tourists, commuters, airport transfers all converging simultaneously
- Sidney residents: seniors frequent midday service for medical/shopping trips
- Saanich Peninsula rural residents: limited service means missing bus has major consequences
- Tourist season (May-September): overwhelmingly ferry traffic with luggage, bikes, confusion
- Winter: local traffic only, dramatically reduced demand, different operational rhythm

## Operational Tips

- **Monitor ferry arrivals**: BC Ferries app shows real-time arrivals, plan for surge
- Luggage management during tourist season: enforce safety rules professionally but accommodate travelers
- Pre-announce clearly at Swartz Bay: "Route 72 to Downtown Victoria via Sidney, Highway 17"
- Sidney locals will be frustrated by tourist delays - acknowledge professionally, maintain service
- Know your bike rack protocols - summer cyclists frequent this route to ferry terminal
- Highway driving requires constant mirror scanning - know what's behind and beside you
- This route gets equipment failures due to distance - radio check essential before departure

## Route Character

The 72 is two completely different routes: tourist ferry service in summer, local community service in winter. Summer operation requires crowd management, luggage handling, and patience with confused travelers. Winter demands attention to schedule discipline and reliable service for isolated communities.

Ferry arrivals create operational chaos. You'll board 80+ passengers in 5 minutes, deal with oversized luggage blocking aisles, answer the same questions repeatedly, and attempt to maintain schedule despite impossible passenger loads. This tests your professional composure.

Highway section requires confident high-speed driving. You're operating at 80-90 km/h in traffic, maintaining long following distances, and scanning for hazards at extended range. This isn't urban crawl - this is highway coach operation.

Master the balance: accommodate ferry passengers professionally while maintaining service for local residents who depend on reliable transit. Neither group should feel their needs are ignored.

## Ferry Coordination

- **Tsawwassen-Swartz Bay route**: Arrivals typically hourly on the hour ±15 minutes
- Major delays (weather, mechanical) cascade through your schedule - communicate with dispatch
- Final sailings (2100-2200) create evening service surges
- Long weekends and summer: sailings more frequent, constant passenger flow
- Winter schedule: Fewer sailings, concentrated demand around arrival times

## Professional Development

The 72 teaches highway driving, crowd management under pressure, and service delivery in dual operational contexts. You'll develop advanced mirror work, following distance discipline, and patience under passenger pressure.

This route demands professional maturity. Tourist chaos tests your composure. Highway speeds test your judgment. Remote operation tests your self-sufficiency. Approach it professionally and you'll develop skills that transfer to any service challenge.
