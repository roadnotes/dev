# Route 30 - Wilkinson Road Express

## Timing Notes

- **Express routing requires maintaining pace** - schedule assumes minimal stops and highway speeds
- Trans-Canada Highway section: traffic dependent, add 5+ minutes during any incident
- Saanich municipal traffic is lighter than Victoria urban core - use this to recover time
- Royal Oak Exchange recovery: 7 minutes including turnaround, tight but workable
- Downtown terminal coordination with Routes 8, 31, 72 - communicate with dispatch on delays

## Safety Considerations

- **Highway merge at McKenzie** - Acceleration lane is short, assertive merge required
- Wilkinson Road industrial area: heavy truck traffic, wide loads, limited visibility at driveways
- **Royal Oak Drive/West Saanich intersection** - Complex phasing, yielding traffic from multiple directions
- Express stops only - passengers unfamiliar with service try to board at local stops, clear communication needed
- Highway speeds demand increased following distance and scanning range

## Stop-Specific Information

- **Royal Oak Exchange** - Bay 4, multiple routes converge, coordinate with other operators
- **Wilkinson/Interurban stops** - Limited shelter, passengers waiting in weather, manage boarding efficiently
- **Carey Road stop** - High-volume boarding point for industrial workers
- Downtown terminal positions vary by time of day - check daily bulletin for bay assignments
- Express stop spacing means passengers walk farther - expect mobility device users needing extra time

## Passenger Flow Patterns

- Commuter-heavy express service: peak direction dominates (inbound AM, outbound PM)
- Industrial shift workers: 0630-0730 AM, 1500-1630 PM create predictable surges
- Airport employees via Keating Cross Road transfer point
- Limited midday traffic - this is peak-hour service primarily
- Regulars know the express drill, tourist season brings confused passengers

## Operational Tips

- **Pre-announce express service at departure**: "Route 30 Express - limited stops only"
- Maintain schedule discipline - you're the express, passengers chose this route for speed
- Highway section requires confident driving - maintain traffic flow, don't impede left lane
- Know your local stop denial procedures - enforce express service professionally
- Farebox issues on express routes create disproportionate delay - address efficiently
- Winter highway driving demands extra following distance - see Winter Driving Pro Note

## Professional Notes

The 30 requires confidence and assertiveness. You're providing premium express service over distance. Passengers expect speed and reliability. Master your timing points, maintain highway pace safely, and enforce express service standards.

This route separates operators who can maintain service discipline from those who let express service degrade into local patterns. Every local stop request you grant degrades service for everyone who chose express service.

Your schedule assumes you'll maintain pace. Highway incidents, construction, or weather will challenge this. Communicate delays proactively, adjust your driving safely, and maintain professional standards under pressure.

Express routes demand mature judgment: balancing speed with safety, maintaining discipline while treating passengers professionally, and knowing when conditions require reducing pace despite schedule pressure.
