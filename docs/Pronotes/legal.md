# Legal Duties of Transit Operators in British Columbia

**Author:** Cliff Clavin, 8-year operator, Line Trainer

## Introduction

Transit operators in British Columbia occupy a unique legal position among Canadian commercial drivers. Unlike most provinces where legal responsibility rests primarily with the employing carrier, BC's legislative framework establishes **shared legal responsibility** between the operator and the transit agency.

This means that as the holder of a Class 2 commercial passenger licence, you personally carry specific legal duties that exist independently of your employer's obligations. Understanding these legal duties is not about fearing liability—it's about recognizing the professional authority and responsibility the law has granted you.

## BC's Unique Approach: Shared Legal Responsibility

Most Canadian jurisdictions structure commercial vehicle liability primarily around the carrier. The company holds the operating authority and bears primary legal responsibility for operations.

**British Columbia takes a different approach.**

In BC, commercial drivers hold **personal legal obligations** established directly by statute. Your Class 2 licence is not merely permission to operate—it is a legal authorization that comes with specific duties. When you sign on to operate a bus, you assume direct legal responsibility for certain aspects of that operation.

This means:

- You can be **personally charged and convicted** for violations of the Motor Vehicle Act, even if following company procedures
- You have **personal liability** for the consequences of your driving
- You hold **independent authority** to refuse unsafe operations, regardless of employer direction
- You bear **professional responsibility** for your operational decisions

Your employer holds **concurrent responsibilities** under the same legislation. Both you and the carrier can be held accountable for the same incident. This shared liability framework recognizes that safe transit operations require both institutional systems (maintained by the carrier) and professional judgment (exercised by the operator).

## The Legislative Framework

Your legal duties come from several key sources:

## Your Core Legal Duty: Section 144 of the Motor Vehicle Act

The foundational legal duty for all drivers in BC is established in Section 144 of the MVA.

**Section 144(1) states:**

> A person must not drive a motor vehicle on a highway  
> (a) without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway, or  
> (b) on a sidewalk without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the sidewalk.

**Source:** *Motor Vehicle Act*, s 144(1)

This section establishes **three distinct offences**:

### 1. Driving Without Due Care and Attention

The law requires you to focus on driving and maintain situational awareness appropriate to conditions.

**Practical application:** You're operating downtown during tourist season. Traffic is heavy, pedestrians are crossing mid-block, visibility is reduced. Section 144 requires you to reduce speed, increase scanning, and maintain heightened alertness—regardless of schedule pressure.

### 2. Driving Without Reasonable Consideration for Others

The law requires you to show consideration—to acknowledge and accommodate others sharing the road.

**Practical application:** You're approaching a merge point where vehicles are attempting to enter traffic. Even though you have right-of-way, section 144 requires you to consider whether it's safe and reasonable to allow merging traffic. Professional operation means facilitating traffic flow, not enforcing your legal rights at others' expense.

### 3. Driving at Excessive Speed Relative to Conditions

The statute prohibits "speed that is excessive relative to the road, traffic, visibility or weather conditions." This is distinct from posted speed limits.

**Practical application:** Posted limit is 50 km/h, you're traveling at 45 km/h, but wet leaves and rain have created slippery conditions requiring 35 km/h for safe operation. Traveling at 45 km/h violates section 144 even though you're under the posted limit.

### The Legal Standard

Courts require drivers to meet the standard of a **reasonable and prudent driver in similar circumstances**. This is an objective standard—not what you personally thought was safe, but what a reasonable, competent professional driver would do.

This standard considers road conditions, traffic, weather, vehicle characteristics, passenger load, time of day, and lighting conditions.

### Consequences of Violation

**Immediate penalties:**
- Minimum fine of $100 (typically $368)
- Maximum fine of $2,000
- Six driver penalty points
- Potential driving prohibition
- Up to six months imprisonment in cases involving injury or death

**Long-term consequences:**
- Increased insurance premiums
- Employment discipline up to termination
- Civil liability for damages
- Potential Criminal Code charges for dangerous driving

## Specific Legal Duties

### Duty to Possess Valid Licence and Insurance

MVA sections 24 and 3 require you to hold a valid Class 2 licence and ensure the vehicle is properly registered and insured before operation.

**Practical application:** Every time you sign on, you are legally responsible for ensuring your Class 2 licence is valid and not suspended. "I didn't know my licence was suspended" is not a legal defense.

### Duty to Carry and Produce Documentation

**MVA section 25(15):**

> A driver shall have his driver's licence and driver's certificate and a motor vehicle liability insurance card... in his possession at all times while driving... and shall produce the licence, certificate and card for inspection on demand of a peace officer.

**Practical application:** Keep your wallet containing your licence in a consistent, accessible location on your person while operating—not in your locker or vehicle.

### Duty Regarding Vehicle Condition

While the carrier holds primary responsibility for maintenance, **you** have a legal duty not to operate a vehicle you know to be unsafe.

**MVA Regulations, section 37.26:**

> A carrier shall not permit a driver to drive, and a driver shall not drive, a commercial motor vehicle unless... the carrier or the carrier's agent has repaired or corrected items listed on the trip inspection report which may affect the safe operation...

**Practical application:** If your pre-trip inspection reveals safety defects (brake issues, steering problems, tire damage, inoperative lights, mirror damage, windshield obstruction, door failures), you have a legal duty to report them and refuse operation until repair.

### Duty to Report Collisions

MVA section 61 requires every driver involved in a collision to:
- Remain at scene or return immediately
- Provide name, address, and vehicle registration
- Render reasonable assistance to injured persons
- Report collision to police if injury, death, or damage over prescribed threshold

**Practical application:** Leaving the scene—even of a minor collision—is a serious criminal offence. Your employer's procedures do not eliminate your personal legal duty to remain at scene and cooperate with police.

### Hours of Service Requirements

BC's hours of service rules (MVA Regulations, Division 18) establish maximum driving hours, on-duty hours, mandatory off-duty periods, and rest requirements.

**Shared responsibility:**
- The carrier must schedule within legal limits
- You must comply with limitations and refuse assignments that would cause violations

**Practical application:** If dispatch assigns you a run that would exceed your legal hours, you have the authority and obligation to refuse. "I was ordered to do it" is not a legal defense.

## The Right and Duty to Refuse Unsafe Work

Your most important legal protection is the right to refuse unsafe work under the *Workers Compensation Act*.

**OHS Regulation, section 3.12(1):**

> A worker must not carry out any work process or operate any tool, appliance or equipment if that worker has reasonable cause to believe that to do so would create an undue hazard to the health and safety of any person.

### What This Means

You have the **legal right** to refuse to operate a bus if you have reasonable cause to believe operation would create undue hazard. This includes:

- Vehicle defects affecting safe operation
- Road or weather conditions making operation unsafe
- Fatigue or impairment affecting your fitness
- Any circumstances creating unacceptable risk

**The threshold is "reasonable cause to believe"**—not certainty, but reasonable professional judgment that a hazard exists.

### The Process

1. **Inform your supervisor immediately** of the refusal and specific safety concern
2. **Remain available** but do not perform the unsafe work
3. **Supervisor must investigate** the concern
4. **If unresolved**, escalate to joint investigation
5. **WorkSafeBC can be called** to investigate if dispute continues

**Critical protection:** It is illegal for your employer to discipline you for a good-faith safety refusal (OHS Regulation s 3.13).

**Practical application:** Winter conditions on Route 95 Express have deteriorated to where maintaining schedule speeds would be unsafe. You have the legal right and professional obligation to refuse operation or operate at reduced safe speeds even if this makes you late.

Document: "Operator [ID], refusing Route 95 due to unsafe highway conditions—ice on Patricia Bay Highway making schedule speeds unsafe. Available for alternate assignment."

## Professional Judgment and Legal Responsibility

### You Are Not "Just Following Orders"

The shared responsibility framework means you cannot delegate your legal duties to your employer. When a supervisor assigns you work, you have a legal obligation to assess whether you can perform that work safely and legally.

The law recognizes that only you—the operator behind the wheel—can make real-time assessments of safety and operational conditions.

### When Your Judgment Conflicts With Direction

**Legal answer:** Your legal duties take precedence. If you believe operation would violate the MVA or create undue safety hazard, the law requires you to refuse—regardless of employer direction.

**Practical approach:**
1. Communicate clearly: Explain the specific legal or safety concern
2. Propose alternatives: Offer solutions that address the concern
3. Document: Create written record of your assessment and refusal
4. Escalate appropriately: Follow established safety refusal procedures
5. Stand firm: Do not accept pressure to violate legal duties

**Example:** You're assigned a bus with brake concerns. Maintenance says "it's fine, we'll fix it tonight." Your professional judgment says the brake issue may affect safe operation.

**Professional response:** "Under section 37.26 of the MVA Regulations, I cannot operate a commercial vehicle with brake defects that may affect safe operation. This is a legal requirement. I need verification the defect has been corrected, or a different bus."

## Liability and Legal Consequences

### Criminal Liability

Serious driving conduct can result in Criminal Code charges:
- **Dangerous operation** (s 320.13): Operating in a manner dangerous to the public
- **Dangerous operation causing bodily harm** (s 320.13(2))
- **Dangerous operation causing death** (s 320.13(3))

These carry potential imprisonment, criminal records, and driving prohibitions.

### Civil Liability

Even while operating within employment, you can be personally sued for negligence if your driving causes injury or property damage. Section 144 convictions create strong evidence of negligence in civil cases.

### Employment Consequences

- Company discipline (warnings, suspensions, termination)
- Union grievance processes
- Impact on career advancement
- Professional reputation effects

## Practical Integration: Legal Duties in Daily Operations

### Pre-Trip Inspection

**Legal duty:** MVA Reg s 37.26 (operating unsafe vehicles)  
**Professional practice:** Conduct systematic pre-trip. Document defects. Refuse operation if critical safety defects exist. Do not accept pressure to "just take it out."

### Speed Management

**Legal duty:** MVA s 144(1)(a) and (c)  
**Professional practice:** Set speed based on actual conditions, not posted limits or schedule pressure. You have legal authority to adjust speed when conditions require it.

### Hours of Service Compliance

**Legal duty:** MVA Reg Division 18  
**Professional practice:** Track hours accurately. Refuse assignments causing violations. Communicate proactively when approaching limits.

### Collision Response

**Legal duty:** MVA s 61  
**Professional practice:** Stop immediately. Secure scene. Check for injuries. Provide information. Call police. Document everything. Your legal duty to remain at scene takes precedence over operational concerns.

### Safety Refusals

**Legal duty:** OHS Reg s 3.12  
**Professional practice:** Trust your professional judgment. If you believe a safety hazard exists, refuse the work and articulate the specific concern.

## Conclusion

As a Class 2 commercial passenger vehicle operator in British Columbia, you hold significant legal duties established directly by statute. These duties exist independently of your employment and create personal legal responsibilities you cannot delegate.

Your legal duties are not burdens—they are the foundation of professional practice. They grant you authority to make safety decisions, to refuse unsafe work, and to exercise judgment about operational conditions. They also create accountability for those decisions.

Understanding your legal responsibilities allows you to practice your profession confidently, knowing when you have authority to act, when you have obligation to refuse, and when you need to exercise judgment rather than simply following direction.

Professional transit operators don't just drive buses. They exercise legal authority, fulfill statutory duties, and accept professional accountability for safe operations. That's what the law requires. That's what the profession demands. That's what your passengers deserve.

**Master your legal duties. Exercise your professional judgment. Operate lawfully, safely, and professionally. Every shift. Every trip. Every time.**
