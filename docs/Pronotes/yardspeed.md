# Speed Limits in Transit Yards: Professional Discipline

**Author:** Jennifer Okonkwo, 18-year operator, Safety Committee Member

## The 15 km/h Rule

Every transit yard has posted speed limits. Most commonly: 15 km/h throughout the yard, sometimes reduced to 10 km/h in specific high-traffic areas.

These limits are not suggestions. They are operational requirements with the same binding authority as public road speed limits - actually more, because they're workplace safety rules under occupational health and safety legislation.

Yet yard speed violations are among the most common operator infractions. Why?

## Why Operators Speed in Yards

**Common rationalizations:**

- "I'm late getting out"
- "Everyone does it"
- "It's a straight section with good visibility"
- "I'm experienced, I can handle it"
- "15 km/h feels ridiculously slow"
- "Nothing's ever happened"

Every one of these is an excuse, not a reason. Let's address them professionally.

## The Actual Reasons for Yard Speed Limits

**Reason 1: Pedestrian safety in high-density environments**

Transit yards concentrate workers and buses in confined spaces. Mechanics, fuelers, cleaners, supervisors, other operators, and administrative staff all move through yard spaces where buses operate.

**The physics:**

- At 15 km/h, stopping distance is approximately 5-7 meters including reaction time
- At 25 km/h, stopping distance increases to 12-15 meters
- At 30 km/h, stopping distance extends to 18-22 meters

**The operational reality:**

Workers step from between parked buses. Mechanics emerge from underneath coaches. Fuelers cross between pumps and buses. Door-side pedestrian approaches are invisible to operators until they're in your path.

At 15 km/h, you can stop. At 25-30 km/h, you're going to hit them.

**Reason 2: Vehicle conflict zones**

Yards are designed for bus movement, but the design assumes compliance with speed limits. Sight lines, intersection spacing, and movement patterns all assume 15 km/h maximum speeds.

Buses back out of parking rows. Coaches turn into fueling queues. Vehicles converge at wash rack entries. These designed conflict points have adequate safety margins at 15 km/h. They become collision scenarios at higher speeds.

**Reason 3: Equipment and infrastructure protection**

Yards contain fueling infrastructure, washing equipment, pedestrian walkways, building structures, and parked buses representing millions of dollars in capital assets.

Low speed limits protect this infrastructure from impact damage. More importantly, they create time for operators to identify and avoid contact situations before they become collisions.

**Reason 4: Professional culture and discipline**

Speed limit compliance in yards demonstrates operational discipline. If operators won't follow basic speed rules in a controlled environment, what does that say about rule compliance on public roads?

Yard behavior sets professional tone. Disciplined yard operation correlates with disciplined route operation. Sloppy yard habits predict sloppy road habits.

## The "Everyone Does It" Fallacy

**Observation:** Yes, many operators exceed yard speed limits.

**Conclusion:** This makes it normal, not acceptable.

Professional standards don't derive from common practice. They derive from safety requirements and operational rules. If everyone routinely violated service brake inspection requirements, that wouldn't make brake inspection optional - it would mean everyone's creating risk.

Yard speeding is no different. Widespread violation doesn't validate the behavior; it indicates a systemic culture problem that professional operators should resist, not join.

## The Experience Argument

"I've been driving for 15 years, I can handle 25 km/h in the yard safely."

**Response:** Your experience lets you *get away with* 25 km/h in the yard most of the time. That's not the same as safe operation.

**The risk math:**

If you operate 250 days per year, entering and exiting the yard twice daily, that's 500 yard transits per year. Over 15 years: 7,500 yard transits.

If each transit has a 0.1% chance of a pedestrian conflict (conservative estimate in a busy yard), you have 7-8 expected conflict scenarios over that period.

At 15 km/h, those conflicts result in near-misses and stopped-in-time incidents. At 25-30 km/h, some percentage become contact incidents. Your experience doesn't change the math - it just means you've been lucky so far.

**Professional standard:** Safe operation is not "getting away with it most of the time." Safe operation is "designed to prevent incidents even when conditions align badly."

## The Time Pressure Excuse

"I'm running late, I need to get out."

**Reality check:** Distance through typical transit yard: 400-800 meters.

**Time difference:**

- At 15 km/h: 96-192 seconds (1.5-3 minutes)
- At 30 km/h: 48-96 seconds (0.75-1.5 minutes)

**Time saved by doubling speed limit:** 48-96 seconds. Less than two minutes.

**Time cost if you hit something:**

- Minor property damage incident: 30-60 minutes for reports, photos, witness statements
- Injury incident: Hours for investigation, potential shift end, discipline process
- Serious injury or fatality: Career-ending event

**Professional question:** Is 90 seconds worth your career?

## Enforcement and Consequences

Many operators speed in yards because enforcement is inconsistent. Supervisors are busy, yard speeds are hard to monitor continuously, and unless you cause an incident, you'll probably get away with it.

**This is irrelevant to professional practice.**

Professional operators follow safety rules because they're safety rules, not because enforcement is consistent. Your professional obligation doesn't vary with enforcement probability.

**Documented consequences when you're caught:**

- First offense: Typically documented counseling
- Repeat offenses: Progressive discipline up to suspension
- If incident occurs during violation: Accelerated discipline, potential termination
- If injury occurs: Workers' compensation implications, potential personal liability

**Undocumented consequences:**

- Culture contribution: Your behavior influences newer operators
- Professional reputation: Other operators and supervisors notice
- Personal risk tolerance normalization: Small violations predict larger ones

## Building Compliant Habits

**For operators who currently exceed yard limits:**

Changing established habits requires conscious effort. Here's the professional approach:

**Step 1: Commit to the standard**

Acknowledge that yard speed limits are non-negotiable safety requirements. This isn't about being overly cautious - it's about professional compliance.

**Step 2: Reset your speed perception**

15 km/h feels slow because you're accustomed to higher speeds. This is perceptual adaptation, not evidence that 15 km/h is wrong. Spend two weeks in strict compliance - your perception will recalibrate.

**Step 3: Use speed as yard scanning time**

Lower speeds create time for systematic scanning. Use yard transit to identify:
- Equipment defects on parked buses
- Infrastructure issues requiring reporting
- Worker safety violations you can report
- Familiarization with new fleet or yard changes

Reframe "slow" as "professional observation opportunity."

**Step 4: Plan for time pressure**

If you're routinely late getting out, yard speeding isn't solving that problem - it's masking poor time management. Address the actual issue:
- Sign on earlier
- Streamline pre-trip inspection
- Identify and eliminate actual time wasters
- Communicate with dispatch about chronic timing issues

**Step 5: Model professional standards**

Newer operators watch experienced operators. Your compliance or non-compliance teaches them what's actually expected versus what's officially required. Choose to model professionalism.

## Special Circumstances

**Reversing and maneuvering:** Speed limits apply regardless of direction. Reverse operations should be slower than 15 km/h - typically 5-10 km/h maximum. If you're reversing at 15 km/h, you're going too fast.

**Emergency vehicle response in yards:** If emergency vehicles are operating in yard, reduce speed and yield right-of-way. Emergency response doesn't justify increased speeds - it requires reduced speeds and heightened awareness.

**Inclement weather:** Ice, snow, or wet conditions require speed reduction below posted limits. 15 km/h is the maximum, not the target. Adjust for conditions.

## Professional Standards Summary

Yard speed limit compliance is basic professional discipline. It's not advanced skill, complex judgment, or situational ethics. It's simple rule-following that protects workers, equipment, and your career.

**Your professional obligations:**

1. Know posted speed limits for all yard areas
2. Comply with posted limits regardless of time pressure or common practice
3. Adjust speeds below limits when conditions warrant
4. Report other operators' egregious violations when they create clear hazards
5. Model compliance for newer operators

**What yard speed compliance is not:**

- Being overly cautious or slow
- Wasting time
- Optional when you're experienced
- Subject to time pressure exceptions

**What yard speed compliance is:**

- Minimum professional standard
- Non-negotiable safety requirement
- Culture indicator for your operation
- Foundation of disciplined professional practice

## Final Thought

Every operator reading this knows the yard speed limit. Most have exceeded it. Some regularly exceed it. A few will continue exceeding it even after reading this article.

The difference between knowing the standard and meeting the standard is professional discipline.

Transit operations require constant judgment calls in ambiguous situations. Yard speed limits aren't one of them. The rule is clear, the reasons are sound, and the compliance is straightforward.

If you can't follow a simple, clear, well-justified speed limit in a controlled environment, what does that say about your judgment in complex, ambiguous road situations?

Be the professional who maintains standards even when enforcement is lax, even when others violate them, even when you're running late. That's what professionalism means.

15 km/h. Every time. No exceptions.
